                                CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity platform, is currently making headlines as it found
                                itself at the centre of a global outage that impacted numerous sectors, causing
                                significant disruptions for major corporations, airlines, and banks. Many users from
                                India, Japan, Canada, Australia, and other countries reported encountering the Blue
                                Screen of Death (BSOD) error on Windows machines running CrowdStrike’s software.

                                In response to the outage, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has posted on X (formerly
                                Twitter), “CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in
                                a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is
                                not a security incident or cyberattack.
                                Kurtz further mentioned that the issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been
                                deployed. “We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will
                                continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. We further recommend
                                organisations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through
                                official channels. Our team is fully mobilised to ensure the security and stability of
                                CrowdStrike customers,” he added.

                                Despite reassurances, the impact of this outage has been widespread. Airlines such as
                                IndiGo have had to revert to manual check-ins at Delhi Airport, leading to delays and
                                frustration among travellers. Banks also reported issues with online banking and
                                transactions, highlighting the severity of the disruption.
